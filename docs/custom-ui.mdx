## ðŸŽ¨ Creating a custom interface

Our builder provides a custom factory. <br>
Now you have access to the builder property and can create your own camera experience. <br>
The camera preview will be visible behind what you will provide to our builder.

> Note 
> Only the camera preview is not customizable yet

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(
    initialCaptureMode: CaptureModes.PHOTO,
    picturePathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    videoPathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    builder: (state) {
        // create your interface here 
    },
),
```
