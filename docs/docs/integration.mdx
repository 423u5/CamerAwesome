# Integration

There is 2 integrations types
- use our awesome built in interface 
- or customize it as you want. 

<br/>

## Awesome build-in interface
Just use our builder. <br>
That's all you need to create a complete camera experience within you app.
```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(
    initialCaptureMode: CaptureModes.PHOTO,
    picturePathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    videoPathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    onMediaTap: (mediaCapture) {
        OpenFile.open(mediaCapture.filePath);
    },
),
```

## Creating a custom interface

Our builder provides a custom factory. <br>
Now you have access to the builder property and can create your own camera experience. <br>
The camera preview will be visible behind what you will provide to our builder.

> Note <br/>
> The camera is not customizable yet

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(
    initialCaptureMode: CaptureModes.PHOTO,
    picturePathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    videoPathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    builder: (state) {
        // create your interface here 
    },
),
```

### Working with the custom builder

Here is the definition of our builder method. 
```dart
typedef CameraLayoutBuilder = Widget Function(CameraState cameraState);
```
<br/>
The only thing you have access is the cameraState.<br/>
Depending on which state is our camera experience you will have access to some different method. <br/>
<br/>
Using the state you can do anything you need without having to think about the camera flow<br/>
On app start we are in [PreparingCameraState]<br/>
Then depending on the initialCaptureMode you set you will be [PictureCameraState] or [VideoCameraState]<br/>
Starting a video will push a [VideoRecordingCameraState]<br/>
Stopping the video will push back the [VideoCameraState]<br/>
<br/>
Also if you want to use some specific function you can use the when method so you can write like this.<br/>

```dart
state.when(
    onPictureMode: (pictureState) => pictureState.start(),
    onVideoMode: (videoState) => videoState.start(),
    onVideoRecordingMode: (videoState) => videoState.pause(),
);
```
