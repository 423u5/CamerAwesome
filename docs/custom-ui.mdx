## ðŸŽ¨ Creating a custom interface

Our builder provides a custom factory. 
Now you have access to the builder property and can create your own camera experience without worrying about the camera flow. (ex: clicking on take picture while camera is not ready...)
The camera preview will be visible behind what you will provide to our builder.

> Note 
> Only the camera preview is not customizable yet

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(
    initialCaptureMode: CaptureModes.PHOTO,
    picturePathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    videoPathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    builder: (state) {
        // create your interface here 
    },
),
```

| **onImageForAnalysis**           | Callback that will provide an image stream for AI analysis |

| **builder** | Create your own interface using the builder method. |


### Builder method

The builder method is the principal method here. 

```dart
typedef CameraLayoutBuilder = Widget Function(CameraState cameraModeState);
```

CamerAwesome now works using a state pattern to make sure you can only call methods depending on the camera current state. 
The magic is that you don't have to do anything appart calling some methods using the state. 

```dart
state.when(
    onPictureMode: (pictureState) => pictureState.start(),
    onVideoMode: (videoState) => videoState.start(),
    onVideoRecordingMode: (videoState) => videoState.pause(),
    onPreparingCamera: (preparingState) => Loader(),
);
```

#### Camera awesome has 4 different states 
- **PictureMode** : This is when the camera is ready to take a picture
- **VideoMode** :This is when the camera is ready to take a video
- **VideoRecordingMode** : This is when the camera is taking a video
- **PreparingCamera** : This is when the camera is starting (then the initial mode will comes)

#### you don't have to worry about state management here
The state is fully reactive and will call the ```CameraLayoutBuilder``` each time you switch between states. <br/>

### Creating my own widget 

You can get inspiration on how we built every widgets. 

The idea is to create every widgets simply from the current state or camerAwesome. 
States gives you access also to configuration that contains flash, sensor, orientation... 
Using only this you should be able to create everything you need without worry about the camera flow. 

**Exemple** 
```dart
class AwesomeFlashButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final CameraState state;

  const AwesomeFlashButton({
    super.key,
    required this.state,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<CameraFlashes>(
      stream: state.config.flashMode$, // here we just listen the current selected flash mode
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (!snapshot.hasData) {
          return Container();
        }
        return _FlashButton.from(
          flashMode: snapshot.requireData,
          onTap: () => state.config.switchCameraFlash(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

> ðŸ‘Œ Every getter terminated with the $ are streams in camerAwesome. 

### Using provided widgets

Either you can use some of the widgets we have provided directly into the repository.
