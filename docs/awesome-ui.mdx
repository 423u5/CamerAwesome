*showcase img*


Just use our builder. 
That's all you need to create a complete camera experience within you app.

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(
    initialCaptureMode: CaptureModes.PHOTO,
    picturePathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    videoPathBuilder: (captureMode) => _path(captureMode),
    onMediaTap: (mediaCapture) {
        OpenFile.open(mediaCapture.filePath);
    },
),
```
